        &nbsp;Dambulla cave temple  also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla is a World Heritage Site (1991) in Sri Lanka, situated in 
        &nbsp;the central part of the country.This site is situated 148 kilometres (92 mi) east of Colombo , 72 kilometres (45 mi) north of 
        &nbsp;Kandy and 43 km (27 mi) north of Matale.<br>
        &nbsp;Dambulla is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding 
        &nbsp;plains. There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. Major attractions are spread over five caves, 
        &nbsp;which contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life. There are a 
        &nbsp;total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include  
        &nbsp;Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres (23,000 sq ft). Depictions on the walls of the caves 
        &nbsp;include the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's first sermon.<br>
        &nbsp;Prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka as there are 
        &nbsp;burial sites with human skeletons about 2700 years old in this area, at Ibbankatuwa near the Dambulla cave complexes.

        Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic; commonly known as the ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව (Glorious Tooth Temple), is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. 
        It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient 
        times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. 
        The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple and the relic.<br>
        Bhikkhus of the two particular chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: 
        at dawn, at noon, and in the evenings. On Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; 
        this holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed to those present.<br>
        The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989, and by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However it was fully restored each time.

        &nbsp;The Kandy Perahera or the Esala Perahera is one of Sri Lanka’s foremost religious celebrations. It has been recorded that &nbsp;the Perahera was held each year since the arrival of Buddha’s tooth relic to Sri Lanka. 
        The Kandy Perahera is an elegant &nbsp;procession or parade that flaunts the various talents of the Kandyan people.The procession begins with the whip crackers &nbsp;announcing the commencement of the event. A group of men 
        strategically crack their coir whips onto the ground to create a &nbsp;spark and notify the crowds about the beginning of the parade. This act is followed by the flag bearers who carry the &nbsp;banners of the different regions and provinces in the country. <br>
        &nbsp;The most exciting experiences are watching the performance of Sri Lankan drummers and the elephant march. Drumming in 
        &nbsp;Sri Lanka is a unique tradition that dates back to 2500 years. There are ten types of drums that are used at the Perahera 
        &nbsp;and often these drumming acts are accompanied by enigmatic dancing. The Perahera is the one place where you could witness 
        &nbsp;the elephant march. A herd of about 10 to 12 elephants are adorned with colorful costumes and taken across the road by 
        &nbsp;mahouts. Also, one of the elephants carries the casket with the Buddha’s tooth relic on its head.
